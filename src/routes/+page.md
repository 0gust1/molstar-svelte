# A collection of Svelte components for Mol* visualizations

This is a collection of [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) components for [Mol\*](https://molstar.org) visualizations.

[Mol\*](https://molstar.org) (/'molstar/) is a modern web-based open-source toolkit for visualisation and analysis of large-scale molecular data

## Goals 
- **Provide a set of composable components** that can be used to build web applications, websites or components enabling visualization and analysis of biomolecular structures.
- **Provide a set of examples** of how to use the components in a Svelte application.
- **Keep the components as simple as possible**, and let the user decide how to use them:  The goal **is not** to provide a full set of components with extensive Molstar API coverage, but rather a set of building blocks (and examples) that can be used to build a custom application.

The components are designed to be used in a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) application, ~~but could be used in any framework that supports [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)~~ (later).

## Installation

```bash
npm install molstar-svelte
```
